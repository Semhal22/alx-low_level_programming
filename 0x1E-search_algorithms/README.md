# 0x1E. C - Search Algorithms
### A search algorithm is an algorithm designed to solve a search problem. The appropriate search algorithm to use often depends on the data structure being searched, and may also include prior knowledge about the data. This project is concerned with implementing some search algorithms(linear and binary in general). In addition to that, identifying space and time complexity of algorithms.
0. Linear search
    * Search for value in an array using Linear search algorithm
    * Print value in array while doing comparison
