0x14. C - Bit manipulation
These tasks are about using bit operators in C for bit manipulation
	0. 0 - Binary number to an unsigned int 
	1. 1 - A function that prints the binary representation of a number 
	2. 10 - Returns the value of a bit at a given index 
	3. 11 - Sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index 
	4. 100 - Sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index 
	5. 101 - Returns the number of bits needed to flip to get from number to another 
	6. Endianness - Checks the endianness(where LSB is stored)
